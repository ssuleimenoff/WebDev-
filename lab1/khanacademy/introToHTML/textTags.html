        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly
        can’t do algebra.<br />
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at
        first.<br />
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br />
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest
        of us.<br />
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br />
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br />
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br />
        Until one day, you walk.<br />
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br />
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br />
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing.</em> And you keep going.<br />
        This. is. learning.<br />
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br />
        You just don’t get it, yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts
        in the whole universe<br />
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br />
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br />
        You can learn anything.
